Client Brief: Virtual Glasses Try On Page

Client name: ClearView Optics
Business: Online eyewear brand selling prescription and fashion glasses
Goal: Reduce hesitation before purchase and increase confidence by letting users virtually try on glasses.

What I want (as the client)

I need a single landing page on my website where visitors can:

Try on different glasses virtually using their camera

Switch between different frame styles easily

See how the glasses fit their face in real time

Feel confident enough to click “Buy” or “View Product”

This page will be linked from my product pages and ads.

Page Sections I Expect

1. Hero Section

At the top of the page, I want:

Headline like:
“Try Before You Buy. See How Our Glasses Look on You.”

Short subtext explaining the feature in simple words

A big “Start Virtual Try On” button

2. Virtual Try On Area (Main Feature)

This is the most important part.

I want:

Camera access with user permission

Face detection so glasses align properly

A default model loads first before camera starts (for users who deny camera access)

Smooth performance, no laggy experience

Controls:

Buttons or thumbnails to switch between frames

Option to change:

Frame color

Frame size (Small, Medium, Large)

Toggle to turn camera on or off

3. Example Glasses to Use

You can use dummy data for the portfolio.

For example:

Classic Black Frame

Transparent Frame

Gold Metal Frame

Round Frame

Square Frame

Each should have:

Name

Price (fake is fine)

“Try On” button

4. Instruction Section (Very Important)

Some users are not tech savvy.

I want a small section that says:

Allow camera access

Position your face within the frame

Select a style to try on

Adjust and compare looks

Simple icons or steps would be nice.

5. Call To Action

At the bottom:

“Love how it looks?”

Buttons:

“Buy Now”

“View Full Collection”

Even if these don’t work, they should look real.

Design Expectations

Clean and modern

White or light background

Looks trustworthy (health and fashion brand)

Mobile friendly

No clutter

Think Apple, Warby Parker, or Ray Ban style.

Technical Expectations (for your portfolio explanation)

As a client, I’d be impressed if you mention:

Web-based virtual try on (no app download)

Face tracking / landmark detection

Optimized for performance

Privacy friendly (no image storage)

You don’t need to build a full ecommerce system.
The focus is user experience + interaction.

What I will judge you on (as a client)

How real the experience feels

How clear the UI is

How fast the try on loads

Whether I immediately understand how to use it

If you want, next we can:

Turn this into a portfolio case study

Write the project description recruiters love

Decide what to fake vs what to actually build

Map features to frontend only if you want to avoid heavy ML

Just tell me the next step you want to take.

what should the navbar have?

Good question. The navbar is subtle, but it signals professionalism instantly in a portfolio.

I’ll answer this as the client, then tell you why it works for your portfolio.

What I Want in the Navbar (Client View)

I don’t want anything crowded. This is not a full ecommerce site.
I want the navbar to feel calm, premium, and focused.

Left side

ClearView Optics
or a simple logo icon + name

Clicking it should go back to the home section.

Center or Right side (Links)

I want 4 to 5 items max:

Try On

Scrolls directly to the virtual try on section

This is the main action, so it should stand out slightly

Frames

Opens a dropdown or scrolls to the frames list

Shows available styles users can try

How It Works

Scrolls to the instruction section

Helps first time users feel comfortable

About

Very short explanation of the brand or technology

Can be a modal instead of a full page

Contact (Optional)

Simple email or demo request

For portfolio, this can link to you
